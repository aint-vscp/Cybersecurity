# Binary Exploit

This Python script is designed to search for potentially vulnerable executable files within a specified directory. It employs a combination of system libraries and command-line tools to perform this task. The primary goal is to identify specific functions within these executables, specifically one labeled as 'secret_function.' This function is often a target in cybersecurity scenarios to demonstrate potential security vulnerabilities.

Here's how it works: the script first searches through the specified directory and its subdirectories to find executable files. Once these files are identified, it uses the 'nm' command, a system utility for examining binary files, to extract symbol information from each executable. The script then attempts to find a function named 'secret_function' within these symbols.

If the 'secret_function' is found, the script constructs an example payload. This payload, in a cybersecurity context, represents a sequence of characters designed to exploit a vulnerability. In this case, it overwrites the return address of the 'secret_function' with the address of the 'secret_function' itself, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect the program's flow.

The script prints out the addresses it discovers and the corresponding payloads for each 'secret_function' found within the binaries. It's essential to emphasize that this script is purely educational and should never be used for malicious purposes. Ethical hacking, performed with proper authorization and in controlled environments, is the only responsible way to apply these concepts. Remember, always respect ethical guidelines and legal boundaries when dealing with cybersecurity techniques like these.
