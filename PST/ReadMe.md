## Password Strength Tester:

The code selects elements in the HTML with IDs passwordInput, colorIndicator, and suggestionText. These elements are typically used to interact with the password input field and display feedback.
An array of common passwords is defined. These are passwords that are frequently used and considered weak.
An event listener is added to the input event of the passwordInput element. This event listener is triggered whenever the user types or modifies the password input.
Password Validation Functions:

isCommonPassword(password) checks if the entered password is present in the commonPasswords array, indicating it's a commonly used password.
isRepeatingPattern(password) uses a regular expression to check if the password contains repeating patterns.
getPasswordStrength(password) calculates the strength of the password based on various criteria, such as length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and assigns a strength level ("Weak," "Medium," or "Strong").
Update Color Indicator and Suggestions:

updateColorIndicator(strength) updates the color indicator element based on the password's strength level. It assigns CSS classes such as gray, red, yellow, or green to visually represent the strength.
updateSuggestions(strength) updates the suggestionText element with password strength-specific advice, like using longer passwords or adding special characters.
