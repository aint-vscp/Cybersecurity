# Key Sequence (Key Logger)

This application will create a log file named `key_sequences.txt` that contains the count of each key pressed. If the `Enter` key is pressed, log the sequence and clear it

# IMPORTANT: This is a simple educational example. Keyloggers can be used maliciously to steal sensitive information. Always use such tools responsibly and never without explicit permission.
